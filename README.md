# 🫀 EDA of Heart Disease
This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of heart disease data, aiming to uncover crucial insights into this leading global health concern. By leveraging the powerful pandas library, the project systematically delves into the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and trends that can help understand the factors contributing to heart disease.

## 🛠️ Data Analysis Steps
1. Initial Data Exploration: <br> 
   Displaying the first and last few records to get an overview of the data.<br>
   Determining the dataset's shape, including the number of rows and columns.
   
2. Data Understanding: <br>
   Gathering information about the dataset, including total rows and columns, data types, and memory requirements. <br>
   Checking for missing data and eliminating duplicate records to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

3. Descriptive Statistics: <br>
   Providing a comprehensive overview of the dataset's statistics to understand its distribution and variability.
    
4. Correlation Analysis: <br>
   Drawing correlation matrices to illuminate relationships between variables, offering insights into potential predictors of heart disease.
    
5. Demographic Analysis: <br>
   Understanding heart disease prevalence, gender distribution, and age demographics within the dataset.
   
6. Risk Factor Analysis: <br>
   Examining chest pain types, fasting blood sugar levels, resting blood pressure, and serum cholesterol to uncover factors contributing to heart disease risk.
  
7. Data Visualization: <br>
   Visualizing continuous variables through plots and graphs to aid in data interpretation and analysis.
